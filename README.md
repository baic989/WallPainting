# Naive wall painting
Wall painting poses a difficult problem in terms of plane segmentation and edge detection.

This version of the app implements the "naive" approach using Apples's own ARKit vertical plane detection.
As can be seen, it is far from perfect.

Future experimental versions will utilize OpenCV for segmentation, tracking and coloring.
